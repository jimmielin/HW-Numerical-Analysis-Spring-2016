# HW-Numerical-Analysis-Spring-2016
Sources for Numerical Analysis course homework solutions, Spring 2016, PKUPhy.

**Note** These sources were uploaded in sync with the course homework in order to track my changes and contribute the potentially reusable algorithm implementations to the open-source community. (Pull requests welcome of course :)) Using them for coursework is greatly discouraged for obvious reasons.
